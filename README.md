# bellabeat-case-study

Using the dataset "FitBit Fitness Tracker Data" provided by MÃ–BIUS on Kaggle I created a mock case-study where I searched for user patterns of usage in their smart device data in order to gain insights that would later better orientate marketing decisions for Bellabeat, a tech company with a focus in women's smart products. My findings can be found on this static website: https://du693.github.io/bellabeat-case-study/

Thanks for checking it out!
